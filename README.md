## Blockchain-1
# Background
You have just landed a new job at ZBank, a small, innovative bank that is interested in exploring what
blockchain technology can do for them and their customers.
Your first project at the company is to set up a private testnet that you and your team of developers
can use to explore potentials for blockchain at ZBank.
You have decided on setting up a testnet because:
There is no real money involved, which will give your team of developers the freedom to experiment.
Testnets allows for offline development.
In order to set up a testnet, you will need to use the following skills/tools we learned in class:


Puppeth, to generate your genesis block.


Geth, a command-line tool, to create keys, initialize nodes, and connect the nodes together.


The Clique Proof of Authority algorithm.
